This repository contains two products.

-----------------

First, most important the Next Delphi Yacc & Lex - Parser generator as described below.
Second, a tool which can created test-projects from lex and yacc files.
This second tool uses examples from the book Lex & Yacc written by John Levine, Tony Mason ad Doug Brown.
Not all examples are done yet, so errors can come up.
These examples are in the directory "progs"
The executables needed to generate the source-code is are already, for your convenience in the directory tools.
In the configuration of the tool, let all sources configureable in disabled controls point to this directory.
If you have no Y-file, but only a L-file, let the Y-file be the default.y which will get configured when cklicking on default.

This project is, like the one described below, under same conditions and license.

    What:
    
    Next Delphi Yacc & Lex is a parser generator toolset for Delphi, based on
    Delphi Yacc & Lex, version 1.4 by Michiel Rook and Turbo Pascal Lex and Yacc,
    version 4.1, by Albert Graef et al.
    
    The primary goal is to clean up the code, and improve compatibility
    and maintainability.
    
    Why:
    
    The project started because the original Delphi Yacc & Lex did not compile well
    in Delphi XE3 and the last release or activity dates back to 2005.
